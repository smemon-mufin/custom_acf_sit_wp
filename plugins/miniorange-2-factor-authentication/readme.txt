 = Why do you need to register with miniOrange in the Two Factor Authentication plugin or miniOrange Google Authenticator? =
 **Two Factor Authentication or WordPress 2FA (WP 2FA) plugin** uses miniOrange APIs to communicate between your WP site and miniOrange IDP. To keep this communication secure, we ask you to register and assign API keys specific to your account. This way your account and users’ calls can be accessed only by API keys assigned to you.

 However, you can use most of the 2FA methods without registration. You must register yourself to use the OTP Over SMS or OTP login via SMS method.

 == Frequently Asked Questions ==

 = How do I gain access to my website if I get locked out using the Google Authenticator - 2FA plugin? =

 You can obtain access to your website by one of the below options:

 1. If you have an additional administrator account whose Two-Factor or 2FA is not enabled yet, you can log in with it.
 2. If you had set up KBA questions as 2FA earlier, you can use them as an alternate method to log in to your website instead of the configured 2FA method.
 3. Rename the plugin from FTP - this disables the Two Factor Authentication - WordPress 2FA (WP 2FA) plugin and you will be able to log in without 2FA.
